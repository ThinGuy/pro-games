# Ubuntu Pro Academy Games Project

A collection of educational games designed to teach users about Ubuntu Linux, Ubuntu Pro, open-source software, and related technical concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## Project Purpose

These games serve multiple purposes:

1. **Educational Value**: Teaching users about Ubuntu history, features, and terminology
2. **Brand Engagement**: Increasing familiarity with Ubuntu branding, mascots, and release history
3. **Community Building**: Creating shareable content that the Ubuntu community can enjoy and discuss
4. **Technical Showcase**: Demonstrating web technologies while promoting open-source values

## Current Games

### 1. Canoncentration (Memory Match)
Our inaugural game challenges players to match Ubuntu release versions with their corresponding codenames through a classic memory-matching mechanic. Players flip cards to find pairs, with each successful match revealing the Ubuntu release mascot.

**Features:**
- Complete Ubuntu release history from 4.10 (Warty Warthog) to present
- Era-appropriate Circle of Friends logos
- Animated OB01 (Orangebox) mascot that reacts to game events
- Educational help panel showing all releases and mascots

### 2. Ubuntu Whack-a-LTS (Reaction Game)
Test your knowledge of Ubuntu's release cycle in a fun adaptation of the classic whack-a-mole arcade game. Players must quickly identify and "whack" only the Long Term Support (LTS) releases while avoiding regular releases.

**Features:**
- Fisher Price style Ubuntu mascot characters that pop up from holes
- Points for correctly identifying LTS releases (+10) and penalties for mistakes (-5)
- Increasing difficulty as your score rises
- Learn Ubuntu's LTS release pattern (every 2 years in April)

Test your knowledge of Ubuntu Pro, security features, and open-source licensing in this comprehensive trivia game. Answer questions correctly to earn badges and climb the leaderboard!

**Features:**
- Three different trivia categories (Ubuntu Pro, Open Source Licensing, Security)
- Dynamic scoring system with streaks and time bonuses
- Achievements and badge system to track your progress
- Leaderboard to compare scores with others
- Daily challenges to keep you coming back

## Upcoming Games

We're actively developing new games, including:

- **Release Road**: A drag-and-drop game where players arrange Ubuntu releases in chronological order
- **Command Conundrum**: Type commands to solve progressively more complex Ubuntu terminal challenges
- **Mascot Mix-Up**: A sliding puzzle featuring Ubuntu mascot images
- **Package Pursuit**: Test your knowledge of Ubuntu package names and functions
- **Desktop Dash**: Learn about the Ubuntu desktop environment and interface elements

## Design Philosophy

All games in this project adhere to the following design principles:

### 1. Ubuntu Brand Consistency
- Use the Ubuntu color palette, with Ubuntu orange (#E95420) as the primary accent color
- Implement the Ubuntu font for all text elements
- Incorporate official Ubuntu logos, mascots, and imagery
- Follow Ubuntu design guidelines for a cohesive look and feel

### 2. Educational Content Integration
- Embed factual information about Ubuntu in gameplay mechanics
- Create learning opportunities through game interactions
- Balance educational content with engaging gameplay
- Provide contextual information to reinforce learning

### 3. Web Accessibility
- Ensure games are accessible across devices (desktop and mobile)
- Design for inclusivity following WCAG guidelines where possible
- Minimize resource requirements to ensure broad compatibility
- Create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes

### 4. Open Source Values
- Release all game code under open-source licenses
- Document code thoroughly to encourage community contributions
- Use standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) without proprietary dependencies
- Encourage remixing and adaptation by the community

## Technical Implementation

The games in this project are implemented using:

- **HTML5**: For structure and content
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For game logic and interactivity
- **SVG Graphics**: For scalable, lightweight visual elements
- **Responsive Design**: For cross-platform compatibility

All games are designed to run entirely in the browser without requiring installation or plugins, making them easily accessible for educational purposes, community events, and general promotion of Ubuntu Linux.
