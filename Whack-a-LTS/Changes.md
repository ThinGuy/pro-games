# Ubuntu Whack-a-LTS Setup Instructions

## File Structure
I've split the game into multiple files to make it more maintainable and to avoid hitting length limits. Here's how to set up the files:

1. **HTML File**:
   - Place `whack-a-lts.html` in the `Whack-a-mole` directory

2. **JavaScript Files** (place in the `js` directory):
   - `whack-data.js` - Contains Ubuntu release data
   - `whack-storage.js` - Handles score persistence
   - `whack-game.js` - Core game logic
   - `whack-ui.js` - UI initialization and event handlers
   - `whack-styles.css` - Game styling

## Implementation Details

The game has been split into logical modules:

- **Data** - Ubuntu release information and default game configurations
- **Storage** - Handles localStorage with fallbacks for restricted environments
- **Game** - Core game mechanics (creating holes, popping up mascots, scoring)
- **UI** - Event handlers and DOM initialization

## Changes from Previous Version

1. Fixed the issue where CSS was appearing as plain text
2. Added proper script closing tags
3. Created a modular structure for better maintainability
4. Added more robust error handling and debugging logs
5. Improved the event handlers for the "Let's Play" button
6. Enhanced image path handling

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Images not loading**: Check browser console for exact image paths being attempted. The current path is set to `../images/fp-mascots/`.

2. **Button not working**: Open browser console and check for any JavaScript errors. The improved event handlers include console logs to help diagnose issues.

3. **CSS not applying**: Make sure the path to the CSS file is correct. The current path is set to `../js/whack-styles.css`.

4. **Script errors**: Check that all scripts are loaded in the correct order: data → storage → game → ui.

## Next Steps

1. Test the game in your environment
2. Adjust image paths if needed
3. Consider adding more features like sound effects or additional visual enhancements
